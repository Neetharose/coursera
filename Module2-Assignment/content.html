    	<h1>Preparation for the Sacraments</h1>
		<p>Saint Mary’s Parish comprises Two Parish Primary Schools, Saint Mary’s Kalgoorlie and Saint Joseph’s Boulder. The Parish of Our Lady of Montserrat Southern Cross has their Parish School Saint Joseph’s also administered by the Parish Priest of Kalgoorlie.<br/><br/>
		Each parish school is treated with the dignity of it belonging to the particular Eucharistic community that it is linked to. Thus each schools independence is necessary so as to be truly Parish Based, Parent Focused and School Supported,  but in cooperation with the Parish Priest and the Archdiocesan Guidelines for Sacrament Preparation of all children within the parish.<br/><br/>
		The after school  sacrament preparation run by the Missionary Sisters Of Charity is also part of the Parish Religious Education Program and open to all parents who desire to have their children prepared by the sisters outside school hours.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>
        <p>The Missionary Sisters of Charity are an order begun in India through the wonderful response to a "call within a call" by Mother Theresa. God moved the heart of Theresa to seek out the poor by taking on the vows of poverty and chastity, to assimilate as far as possible with the same kind of poverty experienced by those in the slums and who experienced homelessness, poverty, sickness and little education. The "being among the poor" and living "with the poor" nurtures the work of missionary charity to better improve the lives of the poor. Prayer, fasting, and an active faith life and participation in the Sacraments of  Eucharist and Penance are pivotal to their lives in serving the poor.</p>
    
    	<h1>After School Sacrament Preparation</h1>
        <p>The Sisters are a major part of our parish and the Parish Religious Education and Sacrament Program.<br /><br />
			All who are interested in having their children prepared for the sacraments are welcome to join the Sisters on Wednesday's and other designated days as part the children's enrolment and participation in Sacrament preparation. The program usually coincides with School Terms.<br /><br />
			The sisters are also available in some situations in helping adults and older children to prepare for the sacraments. These preparation include for the sacraments of Baptism, Reconciliation, Eucharist and Confirmation. The sisters may include some explanation of the Sacrament of healing and Anointing of the Sick<br /><br />
			If you are interested  in the program please contact the Sisters on 9091 8938</p>
			
		<h1>Visitation</h1>
        <p>The Sisters have as a major part of their Religious Charism the visiting of the sick and poor. Home visitations from the sisters are most welcome and they may be contacted so as to invite them to your home for a visit or to let them know of someone you may feel could do with a visit from them.</p>

    	<h1>Becoming Catholic</h1>
        <h2>Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults and Children</h2>
        <p>The standard procedure for entering into and becoming a Catholic as an adult is through a period of time called the 'Catechumenate'. Saint Mary's Parish Kalgoorlie offers an RCIA/C program that begins in October and is completed at the Initiation ceremony at the Easter Vigil mass usually March/April. The fortnightly sessions are either weekly or fortnightly with a break during Christmas and the New Year.<br /><br />
If you are interested in this program, please contact the Parish Priest on 9021 2100</p>

		Please read the following and if you would like to make further enquiries please ring the parish on 9021 2100 
</p>
    	<h2>Called to be a Priest</h2>
        <p>Sometimes young or older men may have thoughts of being a priest, they may sense something moving them to be interested in the vocation even while in their early teens or later in life. Beginning as a call from God but often needing guidance, encouragement and discernment, the parish priest and assistant priests of your parish are always available to help you in this journey.</p>
        <h2>Called to be a Religious</h2>
        <p>The call to "religious service" also is a very important ministry in the Church where the Holy Spirit will inspire a person to a particular charism of service in the building up of God's kingdom on earth.</p>

    	<h1>RCIA Sponsoring</h1>
        <p>An integral part of our life as baptised Christians is the importance of continuing our pilgrim journey of learning and growing in Christ through the ministry of his Church. Opportunities of increasing our faith through better learning and understanding of our faith and the Church's mission in Christ come in a number of ways. Any enquiry is most welcome and special evenings where topics may be discussed with priests or qualified persons can be easily arranged.<br /><br />
        Other activities in the parish are a great means for growing in the faith such as being a sponsor for those participating in the RCIA.  Parishioners are greatly encouraged to walk the journey of RCIA in the role as sponsor to someone seeking to become a member of the Catholic Church. The benefits in terms of growing in one's own faith are significant.</p>

        <p>Welcome to our youth page. We are known as Goldfields Youth Ministry (G.Y.M.). We are a group of young people aged between 13 to 18 years of age. We gather weekly to discuss aspects of the Christian faith, share ideas, and form bonds of friendship. <br /><br />
Our aim is to provide a community where young people feel welcome and be supported and formed in their Christian faith. As a youth group we strive to promote youth activities at St Mary's Catholic Parish which are fun and informative. We meet weekly on Monday evenings between 6:30 and 8:00 PM.<br /><br />
If you would like to be part of our group speak to one of the St Mary's priests or one of our youth representatives. You can also get in touch with us at our facebook page.<br /><br>

    	<h1>Nullarbor Mission</h1>
		<h2>NULLARBOR MISSION TRIP 5.0</h2>
		<h2>30 SEPTEMBER – 6 OCTOBER 2019</h2>
		<h2>REFLECTIONS</h2><br/>
		<h3>Balladonia Station</h3><br/>
		<p>Balladonia station had a padlock on its front gates upon arrival on the evening of Mon 30 Sept. The next morning (1 Oct) a further attempt to visit was successful through the providential arrival of a water truck at the same time as we arrived.<br/><br/>

This year has been a particularly dry year on the Nullarbor and Balladonia station was drastically de-stocking at the time of this Mission Trip.<br/><br/>

At the conclusion of the morning tea there was a spontaneous prayer for rain led by the visiting priest with a blessing of Greg, Cynthia and all those who work on the property.<br/><br/>
</p><br/>

	<h3>Arubiddy Station</h3><br/>	
	<p>We arrived at Arubiddy Station Homestead in the late afternoon of Tues 1 Oct and were able to have a bit of a yarn with the new managers of the station.<br/><br/>

As we hit the road the sun was just creeping below the horizon and it provided for a nice photo opportunity in front of the Station Homestead (see below for a photo of Fr Matthew with the Homestead in the background).<br/><br/>

	</p><br/>
	<p><img src="../images/mission1.jpg" alt="Mission" ></p>
	
	<h3>Eucla</h3><br/>	
	<p>We gathered together with the various Christian residents of Eucla upon arrival in Eucla on Wed 2 Oct gathered together. Among those present at this communal meal was the new community nurse together with her husband and 4 children. It was quite an experience being a part of a meal of 10 people. This never could have been imagined when these Mission Trips first re-started back in early 2017.<br/><br/>

Although not necessarily Catholic, these Christians certainly appreciate having an official Church presence from time to time.<br/><br/>

One of the employees of the Motel was again very happy to have someone to play golf with on this Mission Trip. Opportunities to get away from work surroundings and spend time playing sport etc. with a fresh face are few and far between and very much appreciated by the Eucla locals.<br/><br/>

	</p><br/>
	<h3>Forrest</h3><br/>
	<p>Forrest is the most remote outpost in the Nullarbor Mission. It is a tiny community located on the Trans-Australian railway – 122 kms north-west of Eucla.<br/><br/>

The 4WD track from Eucla to Forrest was tough going. Travelling from Eucla to Forrest, the 122 km journey took 4 hrs 15 mins. The return journey was quicker: 3 hrs 30 mins. This was the same route, it’s just that driver tolerance for rough terrain was higher on the return journey than on the outgoing journey!<br/><br/>

The reason that a community exists at Forrest is because of Forrest Airport – a privately owned regional runway.<br/><br/>

What keeps Forrest ticking over is aircraft re-fuelling. Smaller planes can’t make it all the way across Australia – they need somewhere to stop and re-fuel. Forrest is at a strategic location to meet this need. Both military and civilian aircraft make use of this re-fuelling capability at Forrest.<br/><br/>

On average, 45 people per month make use of the accommodation facilities at Forrest. Of these, the vast majority arrive by air rather than land.<br/><br/>

Railway workers also use Forrest as an accommodation base whilst they carry out maintenance work on the Trans-Australian railway.<br/><br/>

The permanent population of Forrest is 2. These 2 people are the caretakers of the Forrest Airport/Bed & Breakfast operation.<br/><br/>

Caretakers are employed on a 1-year contract.<br/><br/>

Their role is a varied one – owing to the nature of the operation: airport management, hospitality, meteorological services. The current caretakers even reported experiences of having to rescue stray/trapped animals on the property!<br/><br/>

The caretakers provided wonderful hospitality to us on our overnight stay on Fri 4 Oct. Forrest is a wonderful little haven on the far distant outskirts of the Goldfields Catholic Community.<br/><br/>

See below for a photo of us at the Manager’s Residence.<br/><br/>

<p><img src="../images/mission2.jpg" alt="Mission" width="1000px" height="1000px"><br/>
</p><br/>
<h3>Border Village</h3><br/>
<p>A number of familiar faces were present at Border Village on this Mission Trip – as well as some new ones as well.

It was nice to catch up with all of them during our overnight stay at the Village on Sat 5 Oct.

On the final morning of the Mission Trip a large spontaneous gathering of Catholics took place. There were 3 large Catholic families touring around Australia together.

2 people were able to join us for Sunday morning Mass in the Border Village Chapel.

More would have attended the Mass had they not been in such a rush to hit the road for Perth as early as possible on that morning.

Nevertheless, the whole cohort of about 15 people crammed into the chapel for a traveller’s blessing once Mass was ended. It was a special way to conclude this 2nd Mission Trip for 2019 and 5th Mission Trip overall (since re-inception).
